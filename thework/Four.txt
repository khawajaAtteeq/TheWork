ROUTING 

Routing in generic terms for any service, api, website is a kind of pattern
 defining system that tries to maps all request from the clients and resolves
  that request by providing some response to that request.In WebAPI we can 
  define routes in WebAPIConfig file, these routes are defined in an internal
   Route Table.We can define multiple sets of Routes in that table.
