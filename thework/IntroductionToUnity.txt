“The Unity Application Block (Unity) is a lightweight, extensible dependency injection container 
that supports constructor injection, property injection, and method call injection.
 It provides developers with the following advantages:

 It provides simplified object creation, especially for hierarchical object structures
 and dependencies, which simplifies application code.

 It supports abstraction of requirements; this allows developers to specify dependencies
 at run time or in configuration and simplify management of crosscutting concerns.

 It increases flexibility by deferring component configuration to the container.

 It has a service location capability; this allows clients to store or cache the container.
 This is especially useful in ASP.NET Web applications where developers can persist
  the container in the ASP.NET session or application.”
