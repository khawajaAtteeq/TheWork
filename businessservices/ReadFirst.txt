This layer will act as our business logic layer. Note that,
 we can make use of our API controllers to write business logic, 
 but I am trying to segregate my business logic in an extra layer
  so that if in future I want to use WCF,MVC, Asp.net Web Pages or 
  any other application as my presentation layer then I can easily 
  integrate my Business logic layer in it.

We’ll make this layer testable, so we need to create an interface in
 and declare CURD operations that we need to perform over product table.
 Before we proceed, add the reference of BusinessEntities project and DataModel
  project to this newly created project

  "::::::::::::::::::::add the reference of BusinessEntities project and DataModel
